## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - for creating project
- [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) - state management library for React

### What I learned

- how to use Recoil state management. In previous projects I used Redux for state management, but I in my opinion Recoil is a lot of easier to use and understand
- how to update and delete elements in arrays and nested arrays using map and filter methods
